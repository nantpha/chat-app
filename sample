You can phrase it like this:

"To ensure the input speed matches the output speed, we planned and executed the above project."

This sentence clearly communicates the reason for the project and the actions taken. If you need it to be part of a larger context, you might expand it slightly:

"To ensure that the input speed equals the output speed, we planned and executed the above project. This included implementing logic for a Kafka consumer application, designing the application architecture, and coordinating with the team to achieve our goals."
